# SimpleChairs
A simpler fork of Shevchik's amazing Chairs plugin.

## What is this?
A simpler fork of Shevchik's amazing Chairs plugin.

## Ha ha, very funny. No but seriously, why?
Alright alright, sorry. Although Shevchik's plugin
is amazing and works very well for the most part,
I felt there were many features that I personally
didn't need, such as the signs and health regeneration
and whatnot. I just wanted a plugin that made you sit
on stairs (or slabs) when you clicked on them.

So, I made this. I forked Shevchik's plugin, tore out
the parts I didn't like, replaced the name Chairs
with SimpleChairs, and this is what that is.

P.S. It's Paper only lol

## Should I use this?
Maybe, if you want. Shevchik's plugin is great,
but if you too don't want all the extra
features, then maybe you can use this.

## How can I get this?
Check out the [releases page](https://github.com/ItsTehBrian/SimpleChairs/releases),
or alternatively, build it yourself. This plugin
uses gradle, so if you want to build it
yourself in the first place, you can probably
figure out how to do that.

### Thanks?
You're.. welcome?
